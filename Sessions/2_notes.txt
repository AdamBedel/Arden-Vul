Part explored The Basement, destroyed by three stone monkeys. TPK!

New party consists of thief, cleric, halfling, elf :)

Party continued exploring, cleared out the spiders and smoked out the stirges. Found
oubliette. Decided to take a few days off for rest. Game will begin again on the morning of
the 6th.
