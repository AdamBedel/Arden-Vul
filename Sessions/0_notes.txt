7. Some talk about a chasm within the mountain, and claim it's a safe way to travel through the levels. This is a lie, as the
'chasm' is actually the mouth and intestines of an enormous underground serpent.

51. Ancient travelers' reports from Arden Vul describe the Set cult's inability to control a strange variety of floating, jelly-fish-like
parasite. These tiny pests (only 1" long) delivered a painful bite, just like a
horsefly. The cultists found them irritating.

34. We knew some folks who climbed down a well from the surface into the secret halls of Thoth. All but one never
came back, and the one that did was blind and mad! He kept babbling about the dark and the hooting ... the hooting ....

6. Many of the most ardent devotees of Thoth, known as Thoth's Beloved, were buried in a set of catacombs located just under
the Pyramid. They are guarded by the power of Thoth himself, which has prevented all intruders from entering the
catacombs.

51. One of those creepy patrols of dog-men stopped us and asked us if we could procure some rare substance for them. Some
kinda drug called 'rastite lotus powder'. I've never even heard of the stuff. But they were willing to pay a lot in coin and
information for a supply.

81. The greatest alchemist of the ancient empire, Plotina, elected to make her burial along the Drowned Canyon within
Arden Vul. It is said she brought the recipes for her greatest potions with her, along with the preserved bodies of her
twenty lovers.

86. We were waiting to take the lift down to the troll market when a huge troll exiting the lift asked us a question in surprisingly
good Thorcin! It wanted to know if we had seen one of its fellow hunters, a troll named Bedara. When we said no, the troll
spat and wouldn't say another word. I got the feeling that they'd be real friendly if you could find this Bedara.

17. The glorious archon, Marius Tricotor, led the assault on the hoppers from his flying carpet. He and his troops tracked
the enemy to a vast underground grotto, where they found an unholy ziggurat at which demon princes were worshipped.
Marius acquired the name 'Unconquered' (invictus) when he ordered the ziggurat dismantled, piece-by-piece!



Research:

The Pyramid of Thoth

A huge pyramid standing in the ruins of the
above-ground city of Arden Vul. The pyramid was a central site
for the worship of Thoth, and still contains a bejeweled cult statue.
More importantly, the pyramid contains the best and most reliable
way of entering the dungeon levels. It is said that placating the cult
statue is the way to open the route to the dungeons.

The Sundered Span

A prominent landmark within Arden Vul,
this destroyed bridge crosses the Great Chasm at a point about halfway down
the chasm’s vertical distance. It marks the boundary between the
territory of the goblins to the west and the vicious trolls to the
east. A few accounts warn of the swarms of goblins and/or Arden Vul
trolls that guard either end of the Bridge; these enemies must either
be defeated or bribed to allow passage.

The Troll Market

An exotic market in the lower levels where all
manner of bizarre goods - from coins, statuary, gems and magic, to
living creatures and strange plants - are sold by traders hailing from
deep beneath the earth. The Troll Market is operated by the band of
vicious trolls that control the lower levels; they patrol the market
atop giant riding lizards and tolerate no disturbances. In fact,
unless they are well lubricated with coin and/or information, they
are likely to take offense and sell the incautious into Underearth
slavery. Still, the Market is said to be the best place to acquire relics
from the lost civilizations that occupied Arden Vul before the
Archonteans. To reach the Market, one needs to pass the Sundered
Span and traverse the Great Chasm almost to the bottom.

The Great Chasm : nothing


The Ziggurat : nothing
