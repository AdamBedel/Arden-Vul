1. Scheduling:
  - We will play if there is one absence
  - Don't have to always play the same campaign, game. I don't always have to DM. 

2. DnD history:
  - Dates: ADND, B 1977, B/X 1981, TSR bankrupt 1997

3. Old-School Essentials:
  - Classic: 2019 restatement of B/X
  - Advanced: 2022 conversion of ADND to B/X framework
  
4. Arden-Vul:
  - Greco-Roman inspired
  - Written by a professor of medieval history at UNC
  - Many cultures within the setting and the setting's history have real-world analogues
  - Massive megadungeon! It is more than:
    - 1000 pages
    - 2000 dungeon rooms
    - 20 levels / sublevels
    - 15 major factions
  - SPOILERS ARE EVERYWHERE ONLINE! DON'T GO LOOKING!

WILL NEED TO TAKE NOTES, probably in multiple ways. Loot tracking table, some sort of lookup?

5. Content Warning:
  - None. Bad and evil things exist in the world. I have changed some lore I didn't like. I haven't read every page of the book.
