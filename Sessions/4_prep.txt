Chlamidius, Catullus, Friar Theil, Jerry Berrymasher

Theil - brought to -9 HP on the 6th. Will reach 1 HP on the 16th if healing naturally. 19th to get to 4. 
 - Players paid for rooms in the inn until the morning of the 13th. 
 - Theil was down and attacked by stirges, they did normal damage and automatically hit. In a fight against most other enemies, this would be an instant kill.
