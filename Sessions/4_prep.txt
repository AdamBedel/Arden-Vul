Chlamidius, Catullus, Friar Theil, Jerry Berrymasher

Theil - brought to -9 HP on the 6th. Will reach 1 HP on the 16th if healing naturally. 19th to get to 4. In the meantime, he is incredibly weak, can barely limp around.
 - Players paid for rooms in the inn until the morning of the 13th. 
 - Theil was down and attacked by stirges, they did normal damage and automatically hit. In a fight against most other enemies, this would be an instant kill.

Jerry - small silver token taken from the altar. Find out it is a Lover's Token - a somewhat common magic item. 


There once was a phony named Theil
Who thought he'd try adventuring for real
So he rolled in the mud
while stirges sucked out his blood
And I lost all my gold betting he'd keel!

Four “heroes” once strutted without cares
But they’re now only known for shady affairs
Because Chlamidius lies
While Catullus just cries
And Jerry earns his coins upstairs

Because of Dalton's rhymes, party is at a -1 to recruit hirelings at the broken head
