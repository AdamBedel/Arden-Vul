Do we want a "main quest"?

What happened during downtime:

 - Kronos has warmed up to you guys, is now offering quests.
  -- Quests are generally "hunt this monster" or "establish relationships with this faction"
   --- Right now that is a cave bear and the beastmen.
  -- Recognize most of his men, the two lads and two women who Kronos employs for domestic tasks, and 
     his wife Estelle and her clerical services.
  -- Can continue to improve relations via carousing. 

 - Two Adventuring parties came through spending some time at the Broken Head.
  -- The Bad Neighbors, a very large group. Spent only one night and bought out all the iron rations before
     heading back into the dungeon.
  -- Dalton's Darlings, led by a bard named Dalton whom Kronos really likes.

 - Dalton's Darlings recovered the bodies of Kronos's fallen men from the Tower of Scrutiny.
  -- Kronos rewarded them with a private room, but since you guys were already renting out
     the normal private room he kicked his cooks out of their room temporarily. They were not
     happy about this.
  -- Kronos is rebolstering his forces. So far he has made one hire, a dwarf fighter named Ljot. 
     She is popular w/ everyone because she came with a large mastiff named Chisel. 
   --- Men would normally have to babysit the boys when they went fishing / finding firewood (it is
       almost Winter, so they are still in stockpiling mode.) Now Chisel goes instead.
