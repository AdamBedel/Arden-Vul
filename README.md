# House Rules
## Character Creation Rules
  - Roll 3d6, down the line
  - All basic classes are allowed (Cleric, Dwarf, Elf, Fighter, Halfing, Magic-User, Thief) as well as the following advanced classes: Druid (adv), Goblin (cc1), Mage (cc1), and Ranger (adv). Ask if you want an exception. **Many other, sometimes unique, classes exist in the world that must be unlocked through adventuring!**
  - Class Changes:
    - Cleric: List of gods is on pages 6-9 of file "Gods and People of Magea" in the Advanced Rules folder
    - Dwarf: Lose *Detect Construction Tricks* and *Detect Room Traps* but gain Halfling *Defensive Bonus* 
    - Elf: Start with Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook but lose *Detect Secret Doors* ability.
    - Fighter: Gain the additional *Combat Talents* (cc1) optional ability
    - Goblin: *Listen at Doors* (2 in 6) replaces *Wolf Affinity*
    - Magic-User: Starts with Read Magic, 1 random spell, and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook
    - Thief: Use a d6 hit die
  - Abiliy scores may not be adjusted and Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier.
  - For attack and AC values, we will use ascending armor class. (numbers in brackets in OSE rules)
  - Hit points must be rolled, except as 1st level where PCs **must** take the average value (rounded up) for hit points. (d4 = 3, d6 = 4, d8 = 5)
  - Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. Characters know Archontean, one background language, and additional languages based on intelligence. The available background langauges are:
      - Dwarvish, Elvish, Halfing, or if human, Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus.
      - Archonteans + Goblins: No background langauge, but have knowledge of the empire and its history.
      - Any of these languages, as well as *Mithric* (dead language), may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence.

## Combat Rules
  - PCs deal damage equal to their hit die with weapons, regardless of the weapon type (modified by STR for melee weapons).
  - Character damage increases by 1 stage when class to-hit modifier increases.
      - Progression is: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank).
  - Dual-wielding melee weapons or using a two-handed sword grants a single attack with advantage.
  - Shields may be sundered as a reaction to reduce incoming damage from a single attack by 1d12. Magic shields have their modifier-in-4 chance to survive unscathed, otherwise losing -1 from their modifier. 

## Other Rules
  - Slot-Based Encumbrance Rules (cc2) TLDR:
      - One-handed items, shields = 1 slot
      - Two-handed items, ranged weapons = 2 slots
      - 3 torches, 3 oil flasks, or 3 rations = 1 slot
      - Light/Med/Heavy Armor = 1/2/3 slots packed, or 1/2/2 slots equipped
      - Ammo pouches + quiver = 0 slots (already accounted for with ranged weapons)
  - Normal Humans: 2 + CON HP, and deal 1d2 + STR damage with weapons. -1 to hit with all weapons. Level up at 100 XP.
  - All Illusionist (adv) spells are added to the magic-user spell list.
  - Spell Scrolls: can be cast or scribed by an appropriate caster regardless of caster level. Scribing a spell to/from a spellbook or scroll takes 8 hours per book/scroll and requires an INT check for each spell. This can be attempted once per spell per level (or once per day if Acolyte/Mage). Scribing from a scroll destroys it regardless of the outcome. Scribing to a scroll costs 100gp per spell level regardless of the outcome.
  - Armor is renamed: chain -> lamellar, plate -> lorica segmentata
