  - Abiliy scores may not be adjusted, but Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier
  - For attack values, we will use ascending armor class.
  - You can choose to take the average value (rounded up) for hit points at first level only. All other levels hit points are rolled.
  - Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. Characters know Archontean, one background language, and additional languages based on intelligence.
  - Background language:
    - Background languages are: Dwarvish, Elvish, Goblin, Halfing, or if human, Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus.
    - Archonteans: no background langauge, but have knowledge of the empire and its history.
    - Any of these languages, as well as Mithric, may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence.

**Combat Rules**
  - Level 1 characters deal damage equal to their hit die, regardless of weapon type. (ie Fighters deal 1d8, Magic Users deal 1d4)
  - Character damage increases by 1 stage when class to-hit modifier increases.
      - Progression is: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8 -> 2d12
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank).
  - Attacking with two weapons (or with a two-handed sword) grants a single attack with advantage.
  - Shields - can be sundered to completely negate the damage of a single attack. Magical shields can do this a number of times equal to their AC bonus.
  - Spell Scrolls - can be cast by an appropriate caster regardless of caster level.

**Other Rules**
  - For encumbrance rules, see revised character sheet.
  - Magic-users, elves, and half-elves may add a spell to their spellbook upon leveling up and then training with an appropriate mentor.
  - Spell Scrolls- can be scribed from a spellbook or other scroll. Cost/ Time TBD
