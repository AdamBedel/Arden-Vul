# House Rules
## Character Creation Rules
The general rules for creating a character in OSE are found on page 14 of the classic player's tome. The character sheet is on this page as a fillable PDF.  To create a character, follow the following steps:

  1. Roll 3d6 for each ability score in order, no rearranging or adjusting.
  2. Choose a class from below and write down their class features. There are no minimum required scores or Prime Requisites.
    - All "classic" classes are allowed (_Cleric_, _Dwarf_, _Elf_, _Fighter_, _Halfing_, _Magic-User_, _Thief_) as well as the following advanced classes: _Assassin_, _Bard_, and _Goblin_.
    - Class Changes:
      - _Assassin_: Use a d6 hit die instead of a d4
      - _Bard_: Start with Mythric as a language. Use the _Cleric_ spell list instead of the _Druid_ list.
      - _Cleric_: Must choose a god from the "Gods and People of Magae" document
      - _Dwarf_: Lose *Detect Construction Tricks* and *Detect Room Traps*. Increase constituion modifier by 1.
      - _Elf_: Start with a spellbook containing Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell. Lose *Detect Secret Doors*
      - _Fighter_: Gain additional *Fighter Talents* as described in the "fighter_talents" document
      - _Goblin_ : Use the _Gnome_ statblock, but use the _Illusionist_ and _Necromancer_ spell lists instead of the normal _Magic-User_ list. Start with a spellbook containing Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell. Lose _Detect Construction Tricks_ and _Speak With Burrowing Mammals_.
      - _Halfling_: *Inititive Bonus* is changed since we will use group initiative: a party with a _Halfling_ wins initiative ties, rather than rerolling. 
      - _Magic-User_: Start with a spellbook containing Read Magic, 2 random spells, and 1 player-chosen spell. Can also use _Illusionist_ and _Necromancer_ Spells.
      - _Thief_: Use a d6 hit die instead of a d4
  4. Note Ability Score Modifiers:
    - 18: +3
    - 16-17: +2
    - 13-15: +1
    - 9-12: 0
    - 6-8: -1
    - 4-5: -2
    - 3: -3
  5. Note damage and attack values:
    - For melee attacks, you deal damage equal to your classes hit die + your stength modifier. For to-hit rolls, you get a bonus equal to your strength modifier.
    - For ranged attacks, you deal damage equal to your classes hit die. For to-hit rolls, you get a bonus equal to your dexterity modifier.
  6. Note Saving Throws, looking at the chart for a 1st level character of your chosen class. (D, W, P, B, S)
  7.  Write down your max HP. At first level, this is the average value (rounded up) and modified by your consitution modifier. (d4 = 3, d6 = 4, d8 = 5)
  8. Choose an allignment. Lawful good, chaotic evil, etc. (This is unimportant for most people, except clerics who must always match their god's allignment)
  9. Note known languages:
    - All characters know Archontean (aka "Common").
    - Humans must choose a cultural background: Archontean, Thorcin, Wiskin, or Khumus
    - Archontean humans, goblins, and halflings do not get any additional languages, every other class gets their 1 background language for free.
    - You get additional languages based on your intelligence modifier. The languages you may choose are: Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus, Goblin, Draconic, Mithric (ancient language of magic theory), elvish, and dwarvish.
  10. Roll or buy equipment.
    - To buy equipment, roll 3d6 x 10 starting gold and buy equipment, armor and weapons from this lists on pages 40-42.
    - To roll equipment, follow the rules contained in the "roll_equipment" document.
      - Rename the armor gained in this way to follow ADND conventions:
        - Chainmail -> Lamellar
        - Plate -> Splint
  11. Note AC
    - Normal AC comes from your equipped armor. With leather = 12, lamellar = 14, splint = 16, shield = +1. This number is also modified by your dexterity modifier.
    - Unarmored AC is 10 + your dexterity modifier.
  12. Name your character. Recommended conventions are in the "Gods_and_People_of_Magae" document


## Combat Rules
  - Players can take combat actions (attack, move, cast a spell) in any order during the player turn. 
  - PCs deal weapon damage equal to their hit die, regardless of the weapon type (modified by STR for melee weapons)
  - Weapon damage increases when class to-hit modifier increases (every 3-5 levels depending on class)
      - d4 hit die: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 2d4
      - d6 hit die: 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 2d6
      - d8 hit die: 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank)
  - Dual-wielding melee weapons or using a two-handed sword grants a single attack with advantage
  - Shields may be sundered as a reaction to negate all incoming damage from a single attack. Magic shields have their modifier-in-4 chance to survive unscathed, otherwise losing -1 from their modifier.
  - Slow weapon property is ignored


## Other Rules
  - Slot-Based Encumbrance as described in Carcass Crawler 2 (cc2.pdf) TLDR:
      - One-handed items, shields = 1 slot
      - Two-handed items, ranged weapons = 2 slots
      - 3 torches, 3 oil flasks, or 3 rations = 1 slot
      - Light/Med/Heavy Armor = 1/2/3 slots packed, or 1/2/2 slots equipped
      - Ammo pouches, quivers = 0 slots (already accounted for with ranged weapons)
  - Hiring Retainers: Retainers receiving less than a 1/2 share of treasure will not directly engage in combat. 
  - Normal Humans: 2 + CON HP, and deal 1d2 + STR damage with weapons. -1 to hit with all weapons. Level up at 100 XP.
  - Spell Scrolls: can be cast or scribed by an appropriate caster regardless of caster level. Scribing a spell to/from a spellbook or scroll takes 8 hours per book/scroll and requires an INT check for each spell. This can be attempted once per spell per level. Scribing from a scroll destroys it regardless of the outcome. Scribing to a scroll costs 100gp per spell level regardless of the outcome, and can only be attempted if it could be cast by the scriber.
