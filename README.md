# House Rules
## Character Creation Rules
The general rules for creating a character in OSE are found on page 14 of the basic player's tome. Also see the fillable character sheet PDF.  These steps are changed by the following houserules:

  - Roll 3d6 for each ability score in order, no rearranging and no adjusting.
  - All basic classes are allowed (_Cleric_, _Dwarf_, _Elf_, _Fighter_, _Halfing_, _Magic-User_, _Thief_) as well as the following advanced classes: _Assassin_, _Bard_, and _Goblin_.
    - **Other more powerful classes exist in the world that can be unlocked by alligning with certain factions**
  - Class Changes:
    - _Assassin_: Use a d6 hit die
    - _Dwarf_: Lose *Detect Construction Tricks* and *Detect Room Traps* but gain Halfling *Defensive Bonus* 
    - _Elf_: Start with Read Magic, 1 random spell, and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook but lose *Detect Secret Doors* ability
    - _Fighter_: Get additional *Fighter Talents* as described in the "fighter_talents" document.
    - _Goblin_ : Use the _Gnome_ statblock, but with the _Illusionist_ and _Necromancer_ spell lists (not _Magic-User_). Starts with Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook. Lose _Detect Construction Tricks_ and _Speak With Burrowing Mammals_. 
    - _Magic-User_: Starts with Read Magic, 2 random spells, and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook. Can also use _Illusionist_ and _Necromancer_ Spells.
    - _Thief_: Use a d6 hit die
  - Class minimum required ability scores are ignored. Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier and is ignored.
  - For attack bonus and AC values, we will use ascending armor class (the numbers in brackets in OSE rules). At first level your attack bonus is 0 modified by STR / DEX. 
  - At 1st level PCs take the average value (rounded up) for hit points. (d4 = 3, d6 = 4, d8 = 5)
  - We will use the popular two-axis allignment system. _Thief_ and _Assassin_ PCs may not be any form of lawful. Clerics must match their god's allignment.
  - Naming conventions and cleric gods are in the "Gods_and_People_of_Magae" document
  - Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. All characters know Archontean (aka "Common").
    - Human classes choose a cultural background: Archontean, Thorcin, Wiskin, or Khumus
    - Some backgrounds / races grant an additional language: Dwarvish, Elvish, Halfing, Thorcin, Wiskin, and Khumus
    - Archontean and _Goblin_ PCs do not get a background language, but have cultural knowledge of the Archontean empire and its history
    - Any language above, as well as Mithric (the ancient language of magic theory), Goblin, or Draconic may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence
  - For equipment, we will use the "Quick Equipment" table from "cc2.pdf". Armor is renamed to follow ADND conventions:
    - Chainmail -> Lamellar
    - Plate -> Splint  


## Combat Rules
  - Players can take combat actions (attack, move, cast a spell) in any order during the player turn. 
  - PCs deal weapon damage equal to their hit die, regardless of the weapon type (modified by STR for melee weapons)
  - Weapon damage increases when class to-hit modifier increases (every 3-5 levels depending on class)
      - d4 hit die: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 2d4
      - d6 hit die: 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 2d6
      - d8 hit die: 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank)
  - Dual-wielding melee weapons or using a two-handed sword grants a single attack with advantage
  - Shields may be sundered as a reaction to negate all incoming damage from a single attack. Magic shields have their modifier-in-4 chance to survive unscathed, otherwise losing -1 from their modifier.
  - Slow weapon property is ignored


## Other Rules
  - Slot-Based Encumbrance as described in Carcass Crawler 2 (cc2.pdf) TLDR:
      - One-handed items, shields = 1 slot
      - Two-handed items, ranged weapons = 2 slots
      - 3 torches, 3 oil flasks, or 3 rations = 1 slot
      - Light/Med/Heavy Armor = 1/2/3 slots packed, or 1/2/2 slots equipped
      - Ammo pouches, quivers = 0 slots (already accounted for with ranged weapons)
  - Normal Humans: 2 + CON HP, and deal 1d2 + STR damage with weapons. -1 to hit with all weapons. Level up at 100 XP.
  - Spell Scrolls: can be cast or scribed by an appropriate caster regardless of caster level. Scribing a spell to/from a spellbook or scroll takes 8 hours per book/scroll and requires an INT check for each spell. This can be attempted once per spell per level. Scribing from a scroll destroys it regardless of the outcome. Scribing to a scroll costs 100gp per spell level regardless of the outcome, and can only be attempted if it could be cast by the scriber.
  - Armor Renamed: Chainmail -> Lamellar
