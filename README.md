**Character Creation Rules**
  - Roll 3d6, down the line
  - All classic classes are allowed (Cleric, Dwarf, Elf, Fighter, Halfing, Magic-User, Thief) as well as the following advanced classes: Acolyte (cc1), Acrobat (Adv), Assassin (Adv), Barbarian (Adv), Beast Master (cc3), Druid (Adv), Goblin (cc1), Half-Elf (Adv), Mage (cc1), Ranger (Adv)
  - Class Changes:
    - Acrobat / Assassin / Thief: Start at a d6 damage die (not hit die though)
    - Beast Master: Establishing a Connection may be atempted once per animal per day. Speak with Animals' 2nd level feature (only) removed.
    - Clerics: List of gods on pages 6-9 of file "Gods and People of Magea" in the Advanced Rules folder
    - Elf: Starts with Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook.
    - Fighter: Gains an additional feature, Cleave. If they reduce a creature to 0HP in melee, may make an additional attack that turn.
    - Golbin: Listen at Doors (2 in 6) replaces Wolf Affinity.
    - Magic-User: Starts with Read Magic, 1 random spell, and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook.
  - Abiliy scores may not be adjusted and Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier.
  - For attack and AC values, we will use ascending armor class. (numbers in brackets in OSE rules)
  - 1st level PCs may take the average value (rounded up) for hit points. (d4 = 3, d6 = 4, d8 = 5)
  - Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. Characters know Archontean, one background language, and additional languages based on intelligence.
  - Background language:
    - Background languages are: Dwarvish, Elvish, Goblin, Halfing, or if human, Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus.
    - Archonteans: No background langauge, but have knowledge of the empire and its history.
    - Any of these languages, as well as Mithric (dead language), may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence.

**Combat Rules**
  - PCs deal damage equal to their hit die, regardless of weapon type. The only exception is Acrobat/Assassin/Thief, which start at a d6. 
  - Character damage increases by 1 stage when class to-hit modifier increases.
      - Progression is: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank).
  - Dual-wielding melee weapons (or using a two-handed sword) grants a single attack with advantage.
  - Shields- can be sundered to completely negate the damage of a single attack. Magical shields can do this a number of times equal to their AC bonus.

**Other Rules**
  - Encumbrance Rules, see cc2. TLDR:
      - One-handed items = 1 slot
      - Two-handed items, ranged weapons = 2 slots
      - 3 torches, 3 oil flasks, or 3 rations = 1 slot
      - Light/Med/Heavy Armor = 1/2/3 slots packed, or 1/2/2 slots equipped
      - Ammo pouches + quiver = 0 slots (already accounted for with ranged weapons)
  - Normal Humans: 1 + CON HP, and deal 1d2 + STR damage with weapons. Level up at 10 XP.
  - Spell Scrolls: can be cast or scribed by an appropriate caster regardless of caster level. Scribing a spell to/from a spellbook or scroll takes 8 hours per book/scroll and requires an INT check for each spell. This can be attempted once per spell per level (or once per day if Acolyte/Mage). Scribing from a scroll destroys it regardless of the outcome. Scribing to a scroll costs 100gp per spell level regardless of the outcome.
  - Armor is renamed: chain -> lamellar, plate -> lorica segmentata
