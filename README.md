  - Abiliy scores may not be adjusted, but Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier
  - For attack values, we will use ascending armor class.
  - You can choose to take the average value (rounded up) for hit points at first level only. All other levels hit points are rolled.
  - Native Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. Characters know Archontean, one background language, and additional languages based on intelligence.
  - Background language:
    - Background languages are: Dwarvish, Elvish, Goblin, Halfing, or if human, Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus.
    - Archonteans do not get a background langauge, but have knowledge of the empire and its history.
    - Any of these languages, as well as Mithric, may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence. \
Combat Rules
  - Characters deal damage equal to their hit die, regardless of weapon type. (ie Fighters deal 1d8, Magic Users deal 1d4)
  - This damage increases by 1 stage (ie 1d4 --> 1d6) when to-hit modifier increases.
      - Progression is: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8 -> 3d8
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank).
