# House Rules
## Character Creation Rules
  - Roll 3d6, down the line
  - All basic classes are allowed (_Cleric_, _Dwarf_, _Elf_, _Fighter_, _Halfing_, _Magic-User_, _Thief_) as well as the following advanced classes: _Assassin_, _Bard_, _Druid_, and _Goblin_.
    - **Many other, sometimes unique, classes exist in the world that must be unlocked through adventuring!**
  - Class Changes:
    - _Assassin_: Use a d6 hit die
    - _Cleric_: List of gods is on pages 6-9 of file "Gods and People of Magea" in the Advanced Rules folder
    - _Dwarf_: Lose *Detect Construction Tricks* and *Detect Room Traps* but gain Halfling *Defensive Bonus* 
    - _Elf_: Start with Read Magic, 1 random spell, and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook but lose *Detect Secret Doors* ability
    - _Fighter_: Gain the additional *Combat Talents* (cc1) optional ability
    - _Goblin_: Use the _Gnome_ statblock. Start with Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook but lose *Detect Construction Tricks* and *Speak with Burrowing Mammals*.
    - _Half-Elf_: Start with Read Magic and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook but lose *Detect Secret Doors* ability
    - _Magic-User_: Starts with Read Magic, 2 random spells, and 1 player-chosen spell in their spellbook
    - _Thief_: Use a d6 hit die
  - Abiliy scores may not be adjusted and Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier.
  - For attack and AC values, we will use ascending armor class (numbers in brackets in OSE rules).
  - Hit points must be rolled, except as 1st level where PCs **must** take the average value (rounded up) for hit points. (d4 = 3, d6 = 4, d8 = 5)
  - Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. Characters know Archontean, one background language (depending on class), and additional languages based on intelligence. The background langauges are:
      - Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfing. Or for humans: Thorcin, Wiskin, and Khumus.
      - Archonteans and Goblins: No background langauge, but have knowledge of the empire and its history.
      - Any of these languages, as well as Mithric (the ancient language of magic theory), Goblin, or Draconic may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence.

Summary:
- Cleric types: Cleric, Bard, Druid
- Fighter types: Fighter, Dwarf, Halfling
- Magic-User types: Magic-user, Elf, Goblin
- Thief types: Thief, Assassin

## Combat Rules
  - PCs deal damage equal to their hit die with weapons, regardless of the weapon type (modified by STR for melee weapons).
  - Character damage increases when class to-hit modifier increases (every 3-5 levels depending on class).
      - d4 hit die: 1d4 -> 1d6 -> 2d4
      - d6 hit die: 1d6 -> 1d8 -> 2d6
      - d8 hit die: 1d8 -> 1d12 -> 2d8
  - Two-handed polearms (only) may be used to attack from behind an ally (from the 2nd rank).
  - Dual-wielding melee weapons or using a two-handed sword grants a single attack with advantage.
  - Shields may be sundered as a reaction to negate all incoming damage from a single attack. Magic shields have their modifier-in-4 chance to survive unscathed, otherwise losing -1 from their modifier.
  - The Slow weapon property is ignored.

## Other Rules
  - Slot-Based Encumbrance Rules. TLDR:
      - One-handed items, shields = 1 slot
      - Two-handed items, ranged weapons = 2 slots
      - 3 torches, 3 oil flasks, or 3 rations = 1 slot
      - Light/Med/Heavy Armor = 1/2/3 slots packed, or 1/2/2 slots equipped
      - Ammo pouches + quiver = 0 slots (already accounted for with ranged weapons)
  - Normal Humans: 2 + CON HP, and deal 1d2 + STR damage with weapons. -1 to hit with all weapons. Level up at 100 XP.
  - All _Illusionist_ and _Necromancer_ spells are added to the magic-user spell list.
  - Spell Scrolls: can be cast or scribed by an appropriate caster regardless of caster level. Scribing a spell to/from a spellbook or scroll takes 8 hours per book/scroll and requires an INT check for each spell. This can be attempted once per spell per level. Scribing from a scroll destroys it regardless of the outcome. Scribing to a scroll costs 100gp per spell level regardless of the outcome, and can only be attempted if it could be cast by the scriber. 
  - Armor is renamed: chain -> lamellar, plate -> lorica segmentata
