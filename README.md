  - Abiliy scores may not be adjusted, but Prime Requisite score does not grant an XP multiplier
  - For attack values, we will use ascending armor class.
  - You can choose to take the average value for hit points at first level only. All other levels hit points are rolled.
  - Native Languages:
    - There is no aligment language. Characters know Archontean, their background language, and additional languages based on intelligence.
  - Background language:
    - Characters will get a 1 language from their associated background. This can be either Elvish, Dwarvish, Halfing, or if human, Thorcin, Wiskin, Khumus.
    - If Archontean, choose any 1 of the above. 
    - Any of these languages, as well as Mithric, may be chosen as additional languages from intelligence.
