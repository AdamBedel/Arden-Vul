Fighter Talents (Fighters gain a talent as 1st, 5th, and 10th levels)

1. Cleave (recommended at 1st level)
	- When in melee with multiple foes, if the fighter strikes a killing
	blow, they may immediately make another melee attack.

2. Defender
	- When the fighter is in melee with a foe, any attacks the foe
	makes at characters other than the fighter are penalised at –2.

3. Leader
	- The fighter may hire 2 additional retainers, and all the fighter's
	retainers gain +2 loyalty. The fighter and all allies within
	60’ gain a +2 bonus to saves against fear effects.

4. Main Gauche
	- When fighting with two weapons, the fighter gets +1 AC and may sunder
	their off-hand weapon as if it was a shield. This reduces damage by 1d12
	instead of reducing the damage to 0 as shields do. 

5. Slayer
	- The fighter gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls when in combat
	with foes of a specific type. The type of enemy must be chosen when
	this talent is selected. (Examples: undead, clerics, dragons, etc.)

6. Weapon Specialist
	- The fighter gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using a
	specific type of weapon chosen by the player (e.g. maces, two-handed
	swords, longbows, etc.).
